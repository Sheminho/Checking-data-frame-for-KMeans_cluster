# Checking data frame for KMeans cluster
In data science course from University of London in Coursera I was told to check if a data frame with 2 variables can be clustered with KMean Cluster algorithm or not<br>
The main purpose of this data science project is to extract meaningful insights
and knowledge from large volumes of data using scientific methods, statistical
techniques, and computational tools.<br>
So in this project I used **python** in `jupyter notebook` to check if the data frame can be clustered with KMean Cluster algorithm or not,
then i've created a [**report**]() showing the methods i've used in this project.
